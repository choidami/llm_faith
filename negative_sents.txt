Tears fall in the silence of the night.
Shadows lurk in forgotten corners.
Dreams fade into oblivion.
Rain pours on unendingly.
Loneliness echoes in empty rooms.
Hearts break silently.
Hope withers like a dying flower.
Sorrow drowns the soul.
Regrets linger in the mind.
Misery clings like a shadow.
Grief overwhelms the strongest spirit.
Pain hides behind forced smiles.
Fear paralyzes dreams.
Loss leaves a void.
Despair clouds every sunrise.
Anguish whispers in the dark.
Bitterness poisons life.
Dreams turn to dust.
Isolation chills the heart.
Trust shatters like glass.
Promises break easily.
Disappointment weighs heavily.
Darkness consumes the light.
Silence screams the loudest.
Time erodes all joy.
Betrayal cuts deeply.
Words can wound souls.
Winter never ends.
Storms rage without mercy.
Every step is a struggle.
Voices fade into nothingness.
Echoes of sadness linger.
Love decays with neglect.
Beauty fades into gray.
Laughter dies in sorrow.
Stars fall and fade.
Happiness slips away unnoticed.
Roses wither in neglect.
Doubts creep in quietly.
Shadows swallow hope.
Nightmares invade peaceful slumber.
Forgotten like a lost memory.
Scars remain unseen.
Whispers of despair.
Life's colors dim.
Solitude becomes a cage.
Fires of passion extinguish.
Dreams become nightmares.
Smiles hide pain.
Sunsets mark the end.
